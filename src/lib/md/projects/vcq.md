# Overview

This proof-of-concept custom-branded application allows users to dial into a video call queue powered by Webex Call Management Group, establishing a structured connection between the requester and the agent. This web application provides a support queue system for integration into E2C use cases. It allows demo builders to create a custom-branded experience, enabling users to dial into up to 4 queues, each tailored to offer a unique experience while awaiting connection to an agent.

## My Contributions

Over the past couple of years, I have assumed a leadership role, spearheading the architecture, implementation, deployment, and continuous maintenance of this application. Demonstrating a deep technical proficiency, I crafted the application using Svelte and TypeScript in SSR mode. To ensure a responsive design, I integrated standard Bulma styling modules alongside MDI library icons. Notably, I enhanced the application with advanced functionality, such as auto-populating macros, facilitating seamless launches on Cisco Cloud registered devices in kiosk mode.
