# Overview

The Webex Browser SDK enables developers to seamlessly integrate Webex collaboration features directly into web applications, providing a customized and enhanced collaboration experience. With comprehensive APIs and tools, this SDK allows for the embedding of Webex meetings and messaging functionalities within web-based solutions, extending the reach of Webex services into the web environment.

## My Contributions

I had the privilege of implementing significant features within the browser SDK, such as real-time transcription during meetings. This involved leveraging one of Webex's internal microservices, establishing an LLM connection, and validating the data through appropriate modeling. Another contribution includes enabling real-time presence status, utilizing an internal microservice that required enhancements for integration into the Webex SDK component. I took the initiative to adjust both the microservice and implement the module on the SDK side for external accessibility. Additionally, I took the lead in designing the blur background feature using WebAssembly on the browser side. Whenever a web client required a feature not available on the SDK side, I willingly volunteered to implement the feature with technical guidance from the senior engineering team.
