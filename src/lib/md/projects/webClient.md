## My Contributions

I played a crucial role in our team, implementing key UI features within the messaging platform and introducing significant enhancements to the browser SDK, greatly impacting the application. This experience deepened my understanding of backend structures, data modeling, RESTful APIs, and web socket connection logistics. Additionally, I championed and advocated for initiating the end-to-end testing automation process, addressing a significant gap in the application. Towards the end of my engagement, a significant portion of my efforts was dedicated to working on the WebRTC solution and seamlessly integrating the meeting experience into the web client, enabling browser-supported meeting capabilities on the Webex browser client.
