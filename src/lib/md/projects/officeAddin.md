## My Contributions

During this project, I collaborated with another senior engineer to construct the add-in from scratch, utilizing React Widgets to seamlessly integrate the messaging experience into the Office 365 add-in. This initiative attracted considerable attention from the engineering department, leading to both of us taking the lead over the project with the aim of transforming it into a marketable product. Successfully published to the Office 365 store, the add-in met the deadline with ease. Several blogs covered this product extensively, including one written by our former SVP.You can check it out at [this link](https://blogs.cisco.com/collaboration/file-storage-and-sharing). This experience also sparked my interest in AWS and Docker, leading me to delve into DevOps work, where I often volunteered for repository setup and deployment automation, making the process both enjoyable and enlightening.
