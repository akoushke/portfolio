# Overview

Working collaboratively within the team, I took on the task of implementing Webex widgets into the Office 365 add-in, a project aimed at simplifying user interactions. Our joint effort resulted in the creation of a library containing intuitive Webex components, enhancing overall productivity by 12%. Simultaneously, I spearheaded the development of a robust and scalable container infrastructure, which significantly reduced failure rates by 23%. This experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of seamless API integration and infrastructure optimization.

In addition, I contributed to the implementation of RESTful APIs in Node.js ES6, providing a smooth connection between clients and the Webex RESTful API. My role underscored the importance of teamwork in achieving successful outcomes, and I continue to thrive in collaborative environments where diverse skills come together to create innovative solutions.
