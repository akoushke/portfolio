# ReactJS

---

[`ReactJS`](https://reactjs.org/) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed and maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies, ReactJS is widely used for creating interactive and dynamic web applications. Unlike traditional templating engines, ReactJS introduces a component-based architecture, enabling the creation of reusable UI components that manage their own state.

ReactJS leverages a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update and render components, providing a smoother user experience. With its declarative syntax, developers can describe the desired UI, and React takes care of updating and rendering the components as the application state changes.

The library promotes the concept of "learn once, write anywhere," allowing developers to use ReactJS in various environments, such as web, mobile, and virtual reality applications.

ReactJS features:

- **Declarative**: Describe the UI and React will efficiently update and render components as needed.
- **Component-Based**: Encourages the creation of modular and reusable UI components for a scalable application architecture.
- **Virtual DOM**: Optimizes performance by updating only the necessary parts of the DOM.
- **One-Way Data Binding**: Ensures a unidirectional flow of data, simplifying the state management process.

## Example

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(1);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count} * 2 = {count * 2}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
