# JavaScript

---

[`JavaScript`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily known for its role in front-end web development. As a dynamic and interpreted language, JavaScript is executed on the client side, providing interactivity and enhancing the user experience.

JavaScript features:

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables are not explicitly typed, allowing flexibility in assigning different types of values.

- **Prototype-based Inheritance**: Objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects.

- **Event-Driven Programming**: Utilizes an event-driven programming model, responding to user actions and interactions.

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Supports asynchronous operations through features like Promises and async/await.

- **Client-Side Scripting**: Mainly used for scripting in web browsers to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

- **Extensive Ecosystem**: Supported by a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as Node.js for server-side development.

- **Highly Accessible**: Widely supported in web browsers, making it accessible to developers for client-side scripting.
