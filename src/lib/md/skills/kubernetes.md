# Kubernetes

---

[`Kubernetes`](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, Kubernetes has gained widespread adoption and is maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It provides a robust and extensible platform for managing containerized workloads and services.

Key features of Kubernetes include:

- **Container Orchestration**: Manages the deployment and scaling of containerized applications, ensuring efficient utilization of resources.

- **Automated Scaling**: Allows automatic scaling of applications based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and resource allocation.

- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Facilitates the discovery of services and distributes incoming traffic across containers, ensuring high availability.

- **Self-healing Capabilities**: Monitors the health of applications and automatically restarts or replaces failed containers to maintain system reliability.

- **Declarative Configuration**: Uses YAML or JSON configuration files to declare the desired state of applications and infrastructure.

- **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**: Supports seamless updates and rollbacks of applications with minimal downtime, improving deployment flexibility.

- **Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Support**: Works across various cloud providers and on-premises environments, providing flexibility in deployment.

- **Extensibility**: Offers a rich ecosystem of extensions and plugins, allowing developers to customize and extend Kubernetes functionality.

## Example

A simple Kubernetes Deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

This YAML configuration describes a deployment named `nginx-deployment` that ensures three replicas of the NGINX container are running. It also defines the container's image, ports, and labels.

> Kubernetes simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications, providing features for scaling, self-healing, and automation. Its declarative configuration allows developers to define the desired state, while the platform takes care of ensuring that state is maintained.
