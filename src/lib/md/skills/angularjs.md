# Angular

---

[`Angular`](https://angular.io/) is a comprehensive and open-source front-end web application framework developed and maintained by Google and a community of developers. Known for its robustness and scalability, Angular enables the creation of dynamic, single-page web applications with a modular and component-based architecture.

Angular uses TypeScript as its primary language, providing strong typing and advanced features for building scalable applications. It incorporates a two-way data binding mechanism, facilitating seamless communication between components and ensuring real-time updates.

The framework includes an extensive set of tools, libraries, and modules that simplify common development tasks, such as routing, form handling, and HTTP client interactions. Angular's CLI (Command Line Interface) enhances the development process by automating various tasks, making it easier for developers to build and deploy applications.

Angular features:

- **Modular Architecture**: Encourages the development of modular and reusable components for building scalable applications.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Utilizes TypeScript for strong typing and improved developer productivity.
- **Two-Way Data Binding**: Facilitates real-time communication between components, enhancing user interface interactivity.
- **Dependency Injection**: Enables the creation of loosely coupled components, enhancing maintainability and testability.

## Example

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-counter',
  template: `
    <div>
      <p>{{ count }} * 2 = {{ count * 2 }}</p>
      <button (click)="increment()">Count</button>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class CounterComponent {
  count = 1;

  increment(): void {
    this.count += 1;
  }
}
```
